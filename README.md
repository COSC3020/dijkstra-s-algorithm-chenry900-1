# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Recall the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm:
- initialize the dist to each vertex to $\infty$, source to 0
- while there are unmarked vertices left in the graph
    - select the unmarked vertex $v$ with the lowest dist
    - mark $v$ with distance dist
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - dist($w$) = min $\left(\textrm{dist}(w), \textrm{dist}(v) + \textrm{weight of }(v, w)\right)$

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm. Start with the template I provided in `code.js`
and test your new function.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

The choice of data structures is up to you -- your implementation does not have
to be the most efficient one, but please make sure that it is not unnecessarily
inefficient.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

The code will have to run through every node in the graph meaning that we will have O(V).
Then we have my sort fuction for the priority queue assuming worse case it would have to reorganize every node in the graph every time adding another O(V). My add fuction has to add every node to the priority queue so we add another O(V). Finally it needs to add every edge to the distances to find the shortest path so you get O(E). Making O(|V|^2 + |E| x |V|).

code used from my submission last semester I used copiolot to make the test code and help me learn a few lines to do what I needed to do in java.
